# OCD-Patient-Dataset_-Demographics-Clinical-Data
 This project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset
 containing demographic and clinical data of OCD patients. The analysis will focus on
 understanding the relationships between various demographic factors and clinical
 outcomes.
 
# About Dataset:
 The "OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data" is a comprehensive
 collection of information pertaining to 1500 individuals diagnosed with
 Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This dataset encompasses a wide range
 of parameters, providing a detailed insight into the demographic and clinical
 profiles of these individuals.
 
# Result:
  The key findings include-
  - Demographic Insights:
    Majority of patients fall within a certain age range, with a balanced gender distribution.
    Ethnicity, marital status, and education levels affect clinical outcomes.
     
  - Medication Trends:
    Patients are prescribed different classes of medications such as SSRIs, SNRIs, and Benzodiazepines.
    Medication choice appears to be influenced by OCD severity and additional diagnoses like depression and anxiety.
    
  - OCD Symptom Types:
    Common obsessions include contamination and harm-related thoughts.
    Common compulsions include checking and washing behaviors.
    Gender-based differences in obsession and compulsion types exist.

  - Machine Learning Implications:
    Feature selection identifies key variables impacting OCD severity.
    Model accuracy for predicting medications based on patient data remains low (~30%), suggesting more advanced techniques may be required.
